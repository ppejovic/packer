# Custom Data Sources

Packer Data Sources are the components of Packer that allow data to be fetched for use within the configuration.
Use of data sources allows a build to use information defined outside of Packer. An example of
data source is the [amazon-ami data source](/docs/datasources/amazon-ami), which outputs the data of a fetched Amazon AMI.

Prior to reading this page, it is assumed you have read the page on [plugin
development basics](/docs/extending/plugins).

Data Source plugins implement the `packersdk.Datasource` interface and are served
using the `plugin.ServeProvisioner` function.

~> **Warning!** This is an advanced topic. If you're new to Packer, we
recommend getting a bit more comfortable before you dive into writing plugins.
